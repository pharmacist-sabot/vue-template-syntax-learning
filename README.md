## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate into the project directory (such as`interactive-product-list`).
3.  Install dependencies using Bun:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).

## Scripts

*   `bun run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
*   `bun run build`: Builds the project for production.
*   `bun run preview`: Locally previews the production build.

## Notes

*   This project uses Bun for dependency management and script execution, as indicated by the `bun.lock` file.
